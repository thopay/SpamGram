<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
SpamGram takes inspiration from YikYak, but expands on the idea by providing more methods of communication between local users. The primary feature is the local post system which allows users to post status updates or short messages. Users can only see posts from other users within 5 miles. The other main feature is the chat room/group chat that allows users within the area to communicate freely within a group chat.

SpamGram is written with JavaScript and built with React Native and Expo. The backend/API is an Express server connected to a MongoDB database. 

### Built With
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/)
